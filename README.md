# occontext-thinking-trim

OpenCode plugin that trims thinking/reasoning from context while preserving display.

## Why?

Models with extended thinking (Claude, DeepSeek, etc.) send reasoning back in context on each request. This can:
- Increase token usage
- Potentially influence model behavior in unwanted ways

This plugin removes reasoning from the context sent to the model, while keeping it visible in the UI.

## Installation

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["github:old-mikser/occontext-thinking-trim"]
}
```

On first run, the plugin creates `~/.config/opencode/OCTT.jsonc` with default settings.

## Configuration

Edit `~/.config/opencode/OCTT.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  // Enable or disable thinking trim
  "enabled": true,
  
  // Number of recent turns to preserve thinking
  // 0 = trim all thinking from context
  // 2 = keep thinking in last 2 assistant messages
  "keepTurns": 0
}
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable/disable the plugin |
| `keepTurns` | number | `0` | Number of recent turns to preserve thinking. `0` = trim all |

## Example

With `keepTurns: 2`, the last 2 assistant messages will keep their reasoning intact, while older reasoning is removed.
